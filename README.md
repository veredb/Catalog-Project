Chemistry Catalog Project

Readme for the Calendar program
 
1. The relevant files are:
   A. catalog5.rb -- The program for the catalog with OOP
   B. catalog3.rb -- Program with no OOP
   C. elements.rb-- This is the file that contains the row data of the elements, where the program reads from.

2. Goal 
   This program alows you to look up a chemistry element and see its properties, such as its symbol, atomic number, weight, if it is a 
   gas, liquid or solid and the group it belongs to.
   You can look all the elements at once or one at a time. You can also search for an element by typing an atomic weight or you can look up groups of elements by typing their type, or look up all the elements that are liquids, for example.
   You can sort the elements by different categories.

3. Features
   The featurs for the program are the following methods:
   all - to see all elements
   add_element - to add an element
   update - to update an element. make sure you put ifirst the name of the element you want to change and then all the other items
   search_by_name
   search_by_symbol
   search_by_weight
   searcg_by_atomic_num
   search_by_state
   search_by_type
   sort_by_name
   sort_by_symbol
   sort_by_weight
   sort_by_atomic_num
   sort_by_state
   sort_by_type
   

4. Limitations
   Not all elements are added


5. Dependencies
